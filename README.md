## Aquiring MIDI Songs
- Use a MIDI Editor to create your own MIDI Songs
- Use a mp3 to MIDI converter e.g. [Transkun](https://github.com/Yujia-Yan/Transkun/tree/main)
To run it, you use the following command
```bash
transkun mp3_files/wonderwall.mp3 output.mid
```

However, so far, Transukun does not work. Installation via pip worked, but the program states 
"FileNotFoundError: [WinError 2] The system cannot find the file specified"
Although, the file is there. Entering an incorrect path throws a different error, stating the missing filename.
